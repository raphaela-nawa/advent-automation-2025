# Christmas Data Advent 2025
### 25 Real Automation Projects in 25 Days

I'm Raphaela Nawa - BI Specialist and Data Engineer building real data pipelines for real people.

All I want for Christmas is for us to use this AI hype to have more human quality time.
So I built 25 real data automations — one per day — each one designed as a data gift for someone I admire.
Each one tackles a real problem.
Each one eliminates manual work that drains hours.
Each one ships with full code and documentation.

→ **Ingestion** (Dec 1–5): API pipelines
→ **Modeling** (Dec 6–10): dbt, metrics layers
→ **Orchestration** (Dec 11–15): Airflow, monitoring
→ **Dashboards** (Dec 16–20): Looker Studio, visualization
→ **AI Insights** (Dec 21–25): LLM-powered analysis

## About This Project

This repository contains 25 production-ready data automation projects, each designed to solve real business problems for real people. Every project is:

- **Practical**: Tackles an actual pain point for someone I know
- **Complete**: Full working code with documentation
- **Educational**: Explains the "why" not just the "how"
- **Free to use**: Open source for anyone to learn from or adapt

### Philosophy

In the age of AI hype, my goal is simple: **use automation to give people back their time**. Each project eliminates hours of manual work so people can focus on what matters most.

### Running a Project

Each day's project is self-contained in its own directory:

```bash
cd day01
python day01_DATA_extract_ga4.py
python day01_DATA_extract_ads.py
python day01_DATA_load_bigquery.py
```

See each project's README for specific instructions.

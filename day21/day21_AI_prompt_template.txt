# ANALYSIS GUIDELINES
1. **Be Quantitative**: Always include specific numbers and percentages
2. **Identify Causation**: Don't just state trends, hypothesize why they're happening
3. **Calculate Impact**: Quantify the dollar impact of problems and solutions
4. **Prioritize by ROI**: Focus on actions with highest revenue impact vs effort
5. **Be Actionable**: Every insight should lead to a specific next step
6. **Time-Bound**: Specify urgency (this week, this month, this quarter)

# TONE
- Professional but conversational
- Data-driven and objective
- Forward-looking and solution-oriented
- Transparent about uncertainty (use "likely", "suggests", "may indicate" when appropriate)

# WHAT NOT TO DO
- Don't explain what MRR/churn/retention mean (audience knows)
- Don't suggest collecting more data (metrics are validated and complete)
- Don't make vague recommendations ("improve customer experience")
- Don't ignore negative findings to sound positive
- Don't use jargon or acronyms without context

# Delivery Criteria - Modeling Projects (Days 6-10)

## 📋 DECISION MATRIX

### ✅ MANDATORY OUTPUT (You MUST deliver this)

| Item | Description | Location |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **SQL model files** | `.sql` files with documented logic and business rules | `/dayXX/models/` or `/dayXX/sql/` |
| **Data model documentation** | ERD diagram or schema description | `/dayXX/docs/` or in README |
| **Sample queries** | Queries demonstrating the model in action | `/dayXX/queries/` or in README |
| **Reproducible config** | `.env.example` with day-specific variables | `/dayXX/.env.example` |
| **Dependencies** | Day-specific requirements (if needed) | `/dayXX/dayXX_requirements.txt` |
| **Minimal documentation** | README with Quick Start | `/dayXX/README.md` |

### ❌ FORBIDDEN OUTPUT (DON'T do this - will exceed 3h)

| Item | Why NOT |
|------|---------|
| **Dashboards/visualizations** | That's Pilar D (Dashboard) |
| **Orchestration/scheduling** | That's Pilar C (Orchestration) |
| **AI insights/predictions** | That's Pilar E (AI Insights) |
| **Data ingestion** | That's Pilar A (Ingestion) - assume data is already available |
| **Complex testing frameworks** | Only basic validation (< 30 min) |
| **Premature optimization** | Performance comes later, functionality first |
| **UI/Frontend** | CLI or SQL scripts only |

---

## ✅ COMPLETE PROJECT CHECKLIST

### **BEFORE considering the project complete, verify:**

#### **1. Core Functionality**
- [ ] SQL models execute without errors
- [ ] Results match expected business logic
- [ ] Data model is documented (ERD or written description)

#### **2. Reproducibility** (following PROMPT_project_setup.md rules)
- [ ] `.env.example` lists ALL necessary variables (format: `DAYXX_DB_PATH`, `DAYXX_SPECIFIC_VAR`)
- [ ] Variables added to root `config/.env` following existing convention
- [ ] `dayXX_requirements.txt` has specific dependencies (if needed)
- [ ] README has "Quick Start" section that works copy-paste

#### **3. Minimum Quality**
- [ ] Code has docstrings explaining business logic
- [ ] Basic error handling (try/except where needed)
- [ ] Informative logs (print or logging showing progress)

#### **4. Naming Convention (CRITICAL)**
- [ ] All files have `dayXX_` prefix
- [ ] Global variables have `dayXX_` or `DAYXX_` prefix
- [ ] Classes have `dayXX_` prefix
- [ ] Main functions have `dayXX_` prefix

#### **5. Delivery**
- [ ] Git commit with descriptive message
- [ ] Push to GitHub

#### **6. Final Test (5 minutes)**
- [ ] Clone repo in another folder
- [ ] Run commands from README
- [ ] Works? ✅ Project complete. Doesn't work? ❌ Debug and fix.

---

## ⏱️ TIME MANAGEMENT (3 hours)

### **Ideal Distribution:**

| Phase | Time | What to Do |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Setup** | 15 min | Check to see if corresponding folder exists. If not, create dayXX/ folder, set up database/dbt, configure .env |
| **Model Development** | 120 min | Write SQL, test, iterate on business logic |
| **Documentation** | 30 min | README, comments, ERD (if applicable) |
| **Testing** | 15 min | Run queries, validate results |

### **🚨 SIGNS YOU'RE DEVIATING FROM SCOPE:**

- You're building dashboards
- You're writing complex data validation frameworks
- You're doing exploratory data analysis
- You're optimizing performance before functionality works
- You're adding "cool features" not requested

**If this happens:** STOP. Return to requirements. Deliver the promised minimum first.

**Dashboard Integration (Day 19):**
```markdown
## Connection to Day 19 Dashboard

The following views are designed to be consumed by the Dashboard project:

1. **day06_mrr_summary** → MRR Waterfall Chart
   - X-axis: month
   - Y-axis: new_mrr, expansion_mrr, contraction_mrr, churn_mrr
   - Shows monthly MRR movement breakdown

2. **day06_churn_by_cohort** → Churn Heatmap
   - Rows: cohort_month
   - Columns: plan_tier
   - Color: churn_rate_pct

3. **day06_retention_curves** → Retention Line Chart
   - X-axis: months_since_signup
   - Y-axis: retention_rate_pct
   - Series: cohort_month (different cohorts as separate lines)

4. **day06_customer_health** → Health Score Distribution
   - Pie chart: COUNT(*) GROUP BY health_status
   - Table: Top customers by ltv_cac_ratio
```

**Complexity Assessment:**
- **SQL Complexity:** Média (CTEs, window functions, date calculations)
- **Business Logic:** Alta (SaaS metrics são sutis - MRR movements, cohort logic)
- **Data Volume:** 500 customers, 24 months history (~6,000 subscription records)
- **Time Estimate:** 3h (mais tempo em business logic que código)

**Final Validation:**
```sql
-- Run these queries to validate
SELECT * FROM day06_mrr_summary ORDER BY month;
SELECT * FROM day06_churn_by_cohort ORDER BY cohort_month, plan_tier;
SELECT * FROM day06_retention_curves WHERE cohort_month = '2024-01-01';
SELECT * FROM day06_customer_health WHERE health_status = 'Healthy';
-- Should return results with no errors and sensible values
```

**Naming Examples:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
DAY06_DB_PATH = "data/day06_saas_metrics.db"
DAY06_DEFAULT_CAC = 500.0
DAY06_PLAN_TIERS = ['Starter', 'Pro', 'Enterprise']

class day06_SaasMetricsGenerator:
    pass

def day06_calculate_mrr_movement():
    pass

# ❌ WRONG - Generic names cause conflicts
DB_PATH = "data/database.db"  # Could conflict with other days
class MetricsGenerator:  # Too generic
```

### **Day 7 (Carol - Hospitality LTV & Cohort Model)**

**Data Sources:**
- Synthetic guest/booking data (pousada in Campos do Jordão)

**Mandatory Output:**

- [ ] LTV by cohort (how much each cohort has spent to date)
- [ ] Retention matrix (% returning after 1, 3, 6, 12 months)
- [ ] Documented SQL queries
- [ ] Simple visualization prep (CSV or Looker Studio connection)

**When to Stop:**
- ✅ Cohort table with at least 12 months of data
- ✅ LTV calculated with window function (SUM OVER)
- ✅ Retention matrix with at least 3 periods (1M, 3M, 6M)
- ✅ README explains "How Carol uses this for retention strategy"
- ✅ Obvious insights in data (e.g., "January cohort has 30% higher LTV")
- ❌ DON'T do: Churn prediction, real booking system integration, advanced segmentation

),
dayXX_cohort_ltv AS (
    SELECT
        fb.cohort_month,
        fb.guest_id,
        SUM(b.total_spend) OVER (
            PARTITION BY fb.guest_id
            ORDER BY b.booking_date
        ) as cumulative_ltv
    FROM dayXX_first_booking fb
    JOIN dayXX_bookings b ON fb.guest_id = b.guest_id
)
SELECT * FROM dayXX_cohort_ltv;
```

### **Day 8 (Patrick - SaaS Growth Funnel & Cohort Analysis with dbt)**

**Stakeholder:** Patrick (MBA, Strategy)

**Project:** SaaS Growth Funnel & Cohort Analysis (dbt)

**Focus:** Acquisition funnel, activation, engagement

**Data Sources:**
- Synthetic SaaS user events data (visits, signups, activations, subscriptions)
- 10K users, 100K events

**Mandatory Output:**
- [ ] dbt project with 5 core models:
```
  models/
    staging/
      stg_users.sql
      stg_events.sql
      stg_subscriptions.sql
      sources.yml
    intermediate/
      int_funnel_steps.sql
      int_user_engagement.sql
      int_feature_usage.sql
    marts/
      fct_acquisition_funnel.sql (incremental)
      fct_engagement_cohorts.sql
      dim_user_health.sql
```

**Core Deliverables:**

**dbt Models:**
1. **Acquisition Funnel** (Visit → Signup → Activation → Paid)
2. **Engagement Cohorts** (DAU/WAU/MAU by cohort)
3. **Feature Adoption** (which features drive retention)
4. **Expansion Signals** (indicators for upsell)
5. **Activation Rate** (time to first value)

**Output Models (Ready for Dashboard):**
```sql
-- Model 1: Funnel Conversion
fct_acquisition_funnel
├── cohort_month
├── visitors
├── signups
├── activated
├── paid
└── conversion_rates

-- Model 2: Engagement by Cohort
fct_engagement_cohorts
├── cohort_month
├── months_since_signup
├── dau_rate
├── feature_adoption_rate
└── retention_rate
```

**When to Stop:**
- ✅ dbt project runs with `dbt run` and `dbt test`
- ✅ All 5 core models created and tested
- ✅ Funnel stages clearly defined (Visit → Signup → Activation → Paid)
- ✅ Cohort analysis with engagement metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU)
- ✅ Feature adoption tracking implemented
- ✅ Incremental model working (`dbt run --full-refresh` vs. `dbt run`)
- ✅ 5+ tests passing
- ✅ README explains "How Patrick uses this for growth strategy"
- ✅ **Dashboard Integration**: Documentation showing connection to Day 16 dashboard
- ✅ **Architectural Decision**: "Why dbt + incremental models for funnel tracking?" documented
- ❌ DON'T do: Real-time processing, complex ML predictions, multi-product handling, advanced attribution, production deployment

**Expected Files:**

**Dashboard Integration (Day 16):**
```markdown
## Connection to Day 16 Dashboard

The following models are designed to be consumed by the Dashboard project:

1. **fct_acquisition_funnel** → Funnel Conversion Chart
   - X-axis: cohort_month
   - Y-axis: visitors, signups, activated, paid
   - Conversion rates displayed as annotations

2. **fct_engagement_cohorts** → Engagement Trends
   - X-axis: months_since_signup
   - Y-axis: dau_rate, feature_adoption_rate, retention_rate
   - Series: cohort_month (different cohorts as separate lines)

3. **dim_user_health** → User Health Segmentation
   - Pie chart: COUNT(*) GROUP BY health_status
   - Table: Top users by engagement score
```

**Complexity Assessment:**
- **dbt Complexity:** Média (incremental models, macros)
- **Business Logic:** Média (growth metrics, cohort analysis)
- **Data Volume:** 10K users, 100K events
- **Time Estimate:** 3h (dbt setup + models + documentation)

**Final Validation:**
```bash
# Run dbt commands
cd day08

sqlite3 data/day08_saas_funnel.db "SELECT * FROM fct_engagement_cohorts WHERE day08_cohort_month = '2024-01-01';"
```

**Naming Examples:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
DAY08_DB_PATH = "data/day08_saas_funnel.db"
DAY08_ACTIVATION_THRESHOLD = 3  # days
DAY08_FUNNEL_STAGES = ['visit', 'signup', 'activated', 'paid']

class day08_SaasFunnelGenerator:
    pass

def day08_calculate_activation_rate():
    pass

# ❌ WRONG - Generic names cause conflicts
DB_PATH = "data/database.db"
class FunnelGenerator:  # Too generic
```

- [ ] **Incremental Processing**: Only new events processed (production-ready pattern)
- [ ] **Custom Business Logic Macros**: `calculate_stage_duration()`, `calculate_occupancy_rate()`, `unify_platform_data()`

---

## ⏱️ When to Stop

### **Technical Completeness:**
- ✅ Incremental model working (`dbt run --full-refresh` vs. `dbt run`)
- ✅ At least 2 custom macros created and used (stage duration + one business logic macro)
- ✅ Sources declared with freshness tests (both Airbnb + Booking.com sources)
- ✅ Complete funnel with 5 stages (inquiry/booking/check-in/check-out/review)
- ✅ Multi-platform unification logic working (Airbnb + Booking.com unified)
- ✅ 5+ dbt tests passing (unique, not_null, relationships, custom)

### **Business Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Portfolio metrics mart created (`metrics_portfolio_public.sql`)
- ✅ Platform comparison dimension showing Airbnb vs Booking.com performance
- ✅ Occupancy rate calculated correctly (nights booked / nights available)
- ✅ ADR and RevPAR metrics accurate

### **Documentation Complete:**
- ✅ **PUBLIC README** (portfolio-focused, no commercial mentions)
- ✅ **PRIVATE_PRODUCT_NOTES.md** (strategic context for your eyes only)
- ✅ **Architectural Decision**: "Why incremental models for operations data?" documented
- ✅ **Architectural Decision**: "Multi-platform unification strategy" documented
- ✅ Clear separation: Public vs Private documentation

### **What NOT to Build:**
- ❌ Real-time processing (batch is fine for portfolio)
- ❌ Complex orchestration (Airflow/Dagster)
- ❌ External API calls (use synthetic data)
- ❌ ML predictions (churn/pricing models)
- ❌ Production deployment (keep local SQLite for portfolio)
- ❌ Real booking platform integrations

- Average Daily Rate (ADR)
- Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)
- Funnel conversion rates (inquiry → review)
- Platform performance comparison

## How to Run Locally
[Step-by-step setup instructions]

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Incremental Models?
[Explain: production-ready pattern, efficient processing, scalable]

### Multi-Platform Unification Strategy
[Explain: common schema, platform tracking, unified metrics]

### **PRIVATE PRODUCT NOTES Structure (day09/PRIVATE_PRODUCT_NOTES.md)**

**Purpose:** Internal product development documentation
**Audience:** Only you (and future co-founders/investors)
**Location:** Keep local, add to .gitignore

**Required Sections:**
```markdown
# Day 9: Property Manager Data Warehouse - Product Context

## MicroSaaS Vision (CONFIDENTIAL)

### Target Market
- Independent property managers (1-15 properties)
- Currently underserved by enterprise PMS (Guesty charges $30-50/property/month)
- Need unified analytics across Airbnb + Booking.com
- Jo (6 houseboats) = first real user / design partner

### Product Roadmap
**Phase 1 (MVP):** Portfolio Builder
- Public-facing property showcase page
- Unified availability calendar
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Powered by: metrics_portfolio_public.sql

**Phase 2:** Direct Booking Engine
- iCal sync with Airbnb/Booking.com
- Direct booking flow (bypass platform fees)
- Payment processing integration

**Phase 3:** Operations Automation
- Automated guest messages
- Cleaning/maintenance scheduling
- Dynamic pricing suggestions

### How This dbt Project Supports the SaaS

#### Tables → SaaS Features Mapping
- `fct_reservations_unified` → Calendar sync + availability management
- `metrics_portfolio_public` → Public portfolio page (Phase 1 MVP)
- `dim_platform_comparison` → Platform performance analytics
- `fct_funnel_conversion` → Conversion optimization insights

#### Production Migration Path
- **Current:** SQLite (portfolio demonstration)
- **Phase 1 Production:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
- **Migration Strategy:** dbt profiles.yml switch, no code changes needed
- **Timeline:** 2 days after first paying customer

### Competitive Analysis
**vs. Guesty ($30-50/property/month):**
- Guesty: Enterprise-focused, complex, expensive for small operators
- Us: Lightweight, affordable ($10-15/property/month), independent-host-focused

**vs. Hostaway ($25-35/property/month):**
- Hostaway: Good mid-market option, still pricey for 1-10 properties
- Us: Better pricing for micro-operators, simpler UX

### Technical Debt / Production Hardening Needed
- [ ] Add proper error handling in dbt models
- [ ] Implement data quality monitoring (Great Expectations)
- [ ] Add CI/CD for dbt runs (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Set up incremental backfill strategy
- [ ] Migrate from SQLite to Supabase
- [ ] Add multi-tenancy (property_manager_id in all tables)
- [ ] Implement RBAC (owner vs guest access)

### Pricing Model (Initial Thinking)
- $10/property/month (base tier - analytics only)
- $15/property/month (pro tier - direct booking)
- $20/property/month (automation tier - messages/scheduling)
- Target: 100 properties by Month 6 = $1-2K MRR

### Next Steps After Portfolio Delivery
1. User interview with Jo (validate metrics, get feedback)
2. Design Figma mockups for portfolio page
3. Set up Supabase project
4. Migrate dbt to Supabase profiles
5. Build Next.js frontend for Phase 1 MVP
```

**🔒 CRITICAL:** This file NEVER goes on GitHub. Keep local only.

## 🎯 Complexity Assessment

- **dbt Complexity:** High (incremental models, multi-source unification, custom macros)
- **Business Logic:** High (hospitality metrics, multi-platform reconciliation)
- **Data Volume:** 500+ reservations, 12 months history, 2 platforms
- **Time Estimate:** 3h (dbt setup 30min, models 90min, testing/docs 60min)

---

## ✅ Final Validation

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd day09

# Full refresh (builds from scratch)
dbt run --full-refresh

# Incremental run (only new data)
dbt run

# Run tests
dbt test

# Generate documentation
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve

# Validate key metrics

### 3. SCD TYPE 2 - REQUIRED EXAMPLES

Demonstrate SCD Type 2 with at least 2 historical changes:

**Example 1: Asset reclassification**
```sql
-- Equipment lifecycle change
asset_key | asset_id    | asset_name         | asset_class  | valid_from | valid_to   | is_current
----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------
1         | EQ_MFG_001  | "CNC Machine..."   | "Active"     | 2023-01-01 | 2024-06-30 | FALSE
2         | EQ_MFG_001  | "CNC Machine..."   | "Maintenance"| 2024-07-01 | 2024-09-30 | FALSE
3         | EQ_MFG_001  | "CNC Machine..."   | "Active"     | 2024-10-01 | NULL       | TRUE
```

**Example 2: Regulatory change**
```sql
-- Certification renewal/update
asset_key | asset_id      | asset_name      | requirements      | valid_from | valid_to   | is_current
----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|------------|------------
10        | CERT_MFG_001  | "CE Marking..." | "Standard v1.0"   | 2023-01-01 | 2024-12-31 | FALSE
11        | CERT_MFG_001  | "CE Marking..." | "Standard v2.0"   | 2025-01-01 | NULL       | TRUE
```

### 4. ANALYTICAL QUERIES (4 REQUIRED)

**Query 1:** Total portfolio value per client
**Query 2:** Asset allocation by class (show Equipment, IP, Certification separately)
**Query 3:** **MFG Company assets only (CRITICAL - this will be reused in Day 16!)**
```sql
-- Filter for Luna's future dashboard
SELECT
    a.asset_name,
    a.asset_class,
    a.asset_type,
    h.market_value,
    acc.account_name
FROM fct_holdings h
JOIN dim_assets a ON h.asset_key = a.asset_key
JOIN dim_accounts acc ON h.account_key = acc.account_key
JOIN dim_clients c ON acc.parent_client_key = c.client_key
WHERE c.client_name = 'MFG Owner Family'
  AND a.asset_class IN ('Equipment', 'IP', 'Certification')
  AND h.date_key = (SELECT MAX(date_key) FROM dim_date);
```
**Query 4:** Historical tracking (SCD Type 2 demo)

```markdown
# Family Office Asset Management Data Warehouse

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Educational portfolio project with 100% synthetic data. Inspired by conversations with Rafael (cross-border wealth planning specialist) but does not represent any real system.

## Problem Statement
Family offices managing multi-jurisdictional UHNW portfolios face challenges tracking assets across borders, tax treatments, and regulatory changes.

## Solution Architecture
Kimball star schema with SCD Type 2 for historical compliance.

## Use Case (Fictional)
5 UHNW families, 100+ assets, one family owns a European manufacturing company (operational assets will be analyzed separately in Day 16).

## What This Demonstrates
- Dimensional modeling for wealth structures
- SCD Type 2 for audit trails
- Conformed dimensions (preparing for Day 16 reuse)
- Cross-border asset tracking

## For Rafael
Technical demonstration of architectural patterns for complex wealth management. Focus on cross-border tracking and historical compliance.

**Note:** Day 16 will create a compliance dashboard consuming these MFG operational assets.
```

## QUANDO PARAR
✅ Star schema with 5 tables implemented
✅ 5 families, 100 assets (30 MFG operational assets clearly labeled)
✅ SCD Type 2 with 2+ examples
✅ 24 months of holdings data
✅ 4 analytical queries (including MFG filter query)
✅ ERD documented
✅ README with disclaimer and Day 16 connection note
❌ DON'T: Real-time tracking, Bloomberg integration, IRR calculations, tax optimization

## ARCHITECTURAL NOTES TO DOCUMENT
1. Why Kimball? (Performance for cross-family analysis)
2. Why SCD Type 2? (Audit trails: "What was the classification on [date]?")
3. Why include operational assets in family office DW? (Consolidated wealth view + prepares for departmental analytics)
4. Conformed dimensions strategy: dim_date, dim_assets will be reused in Day 16

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Can answer: "Total portfolio value for MFG Owner Family?"
- Can answer: "What was EQ_MFG_001 classification on June 15, 2024?"
- Can filter ONLY MFG operational assets (Equipment, IP, Certification)
- Database ready to be consumed by Day 16 dashboard

**Gere o projeto completo priorizando CLAREZA na identificação dos MFG assets.**

**O que garante que Luna vai poder usar:**
✅ 30 MFG assets claramente identificados (EQ_MFG_*, IP_MFG_*, CERT_MFG_*)
✅ Query específica já pronta (day10_QUERY_mfg_assets_filter.sql)
✅ Account específico: "MFG Company Operating Account"
✅ Client específico: "MFG Owner Family"
✅ README menciona explicitamente: "Day 16 will reuse these assets"

## 🔄 PIVOT RULE (1 hour)

**For all Modeling projects:**

If after **1 hour** you still haven't:
- Set up the database/dbt environment OR
- Written basic working SQL

➡️ **IMMEDIATE PIVOT to simpler approach:**

1. Use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL/BigQuery
2. Use plain SQL instead of dbt (can migrate later)
3. Reduce number of metrics/dimensions
4. Focus on ONE core feature working perfectly

**DON'T spend more than 1h fighting with setup. The goal is to deliver, not perfectionism.**

**Example Pivot Scenarios:**

**Day 8/9 (dbt projects):**
```bash
# After 1h, if dbt setup still failing:

# BEFORE (complex):
dbt init dayXX_project
# ... 30 minutes of config errors ...

# AFTER (simple pivot):
# Create plain SQL files in models/ folder
# Run directly with sqlite3 or python
# Document: "Will migrate to dbt after proof of concept works"
```

**Day 10 (Data Warehouse):**
```bash
# After 1h, if SCD Type 2 logic too complex:

# BEFORE (full SCD Type 2):
# Trying to implement merge/upsert logic with triggers...

# AFTER (simple pivot):
# Create basic dimension table (no SCD)
# Add is_current flag manually
# Document: "Simplified SCD Type 2 - full implementation in production phase"
```

---

## 📊 FINAL VALIDATION (All Projects)

Before pushing:
```bash
# 1. Test in clean environment
cd /tmp
git clone your-repo
cd advent-automation-2025/dayXX

# 2. Configure .env (add project variables to root config/.env)
# Make sure to follow convention: DAYXX_SPECIFIC_VAR

# 3. Execute
python dayXX_DATA_synthetic_generator.py  # Generate data
sqlite3 data/dayXX_database.db < models/dayXX_MODEL_*.sql  # Run models
# OR
cd dayXX && dbt run && dbt test  # If using dbt

# 4. Validate
# - Models executed without errors? ✅
# - Results make business sense? ✅
# - Logs are informative? ✅
# - Naming convention correct (dayXX_ prefix)? ✅
```

If ALL above works → ✅ **Project complete**

---

## 🔧 INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING STRUCTURE CHECKLIST

Before finalizing any Modeling project, verify:

- [ ] Environment variables added to `config/.env` following existing convention
- [ ] Specific dependencies documented in `dayXX_requirements.txt` (if needed)
- [ ] Common dependencies added to root `requirements.txt` (only if globally relevant)
- [ ] ALL files have `dayXX_` prefix
- [ ] ALL variables/classes/functions follow isolated naming
- [ ] README clearly explains how to configure environment variables
- [ ] Project works INDEPENDENTLY (doesn't depend on other days)

**Environment Variables Example:**
```bash
# In root config/.env

# Day 06 - Financial Consulting Metrics
DAYXX_DB_PATH=/path/to/dayXX_consulting.db
DAYXX_LOOKER_STUDIO_ID=abc123

# Day 07 - Hospitality LTV
DAYXX_HOSPITALITY_DB_PATH=/path/to/dayXX_hospitality.db

# Day 08 - Consulting Pipeline (dbt)
DAYXX_DBT_PROFILES_DIR=/path/to/dayXX/.dbt

# Day 09 - Hospitality Funnel (dbt)
DAYXX_DBT_TARGET=dev

# Day 10 - Family Office DW
DAYXX_DW_DB_PATH=/path/to/dayXX_family_office_dw.db
```

**Dependencies Example:**
```txt
# In root requirements.txt

# Day 06-07: SQL + Analytics
sqlalchemy==2.0.23
pandas==2.1.4

# Day 08-09: dbt
dbt-core==1.7.4
dbt-sqlite==1.7.1

# Day 10: Data Warehouse

---

## 📚 QUICK REFERENCE - SQL PATTERNS

### **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**
```sql
-- Basic CTE
WITH dayXX_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        project_id,
        SUM(hours) as total_hours
    FROM dayXX_timesheets
    GROUP BY project_id
)
SELECT * FROM dayXX_metrics;

-- Multiple CTEs
WITH dayXX_billable AS (
    SELECT project_id, SUM(hours) as billable_hours
    FROM dayXX_timesheets
    WHERE is_billable = TRUE
    GROUP BY project_id
),
dayXX_total AS (
    SELECT project_id, SUM(hours) as total_hours
    FROM dayXX_timesheets
    GROUP BY project_id
)
SELECT
    b.project_id,
    b.billable_hours,
    t.total_hours,
    ROUND(100.0 * b.billable_hours / t.total_hours, 2) as utilization_rate
FROM dayXX_billable b
JOIN dayXX_total t ON b.project_id = t.project_id;
```

### **Window Functions**
```sql
-- Running totals
SELECT
    date,
    revenue,
    SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY date) as cumulative_revenue
FROM dayXX_sales;

-- Ranking
SELECT
    project_name,
    profitability,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY profitability DESC) as profitability_rank
FROM dayXX_projects;

-- Lag/Lead (comparing to previous period)
SELECT
    date,
    revenue,
    LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY date) as previous_month_revenue,
    revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY date) as revenue_change
FROM dayXX_monthly_sales;

-- Partition by
SELECT
    client_id,
    project_id,
    revenue,
    SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY client_id) as client_total_revenue,
    ROUND(100.0 * revenue / SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY client_id), 2) as pct_of_client_revenue
FROM dayXX_projects;
```

### **Cohort Analysis Pattern**
```sql
-- Step 1: Identify first event per user
WITH dayXX_first_event AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        MIN(event_date) as first_event_date,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(event_date)) as cohort_month
    FROM dayXX_events
    GROUP BY user_id
),

-- Step 2: Calculate time since first event
dayXX_cohort_activity AS (
    SELECT
        fe.cohort_month,
        fe.user_id,
        e.event_date,
        DATEDIFF(MONTH, fe.first_event_date, e.event_date) as months_since_first
    FROM dayXX_first_event fe
    JOIN dayXX_events e ON fe.user_id = e.user_id
),

-- Step 3: Calculate retention
dayXX_retention AS (
    SELECT
        cohort_month,
        months_since_first,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users
    FROM dayXX_cohort_activity
    GROUP BY cohort_month, months_since_first
)

-- Step 4: Calculate retention rate
SELECT
    r.cohort_month,
    r.months_since_first,
    r.active_users,
    first.cohort_size,
    ROUND(100.0 * r.active_users / first.cohort_size, 2) as retention_rate
FROM dayXX_retention r
JOIN (
    SELECT cohort_month, active_users as cohort_size
    FROM dayXX_retention
    WHERE months_since_first = 0
) first ON r.cohort_month = first.cohort_month
ORDER BY r.cohort_month, r.months_since_first;
```

## 🏗️ ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS REFERENCE

### Pattern: Scheduled Batch Jobs
**When:** Daily/hourly reports, periodic syncs
**Tools:** cron, GitHub Actions, APScheduler
**Key Considerations:** Timezone handling, overlap prevention, failure notifications

### Pattern: Event-Driven Workflows
**When:** Real-time reactions to triggers
**Tools:** Webhooks, message queues, n8n
**Key Considerations:** Idempotency, ordering, backpressure handling

### Pattern: Data Quality Gates
**When:** Validation before downstream use
**Tools:** Great Expectations, custom validators
**Key Considerations:** Fail-fast vs warn, rollback strategies

### Pattern: Alert Routing
**When:** Operational monitoring, compliance
**Tools:** Rule engines, severity classification
**Key Considerations:** Deduplication, SLA tracking, escalation paths

---

## ❌ COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Anti-Pattern: "Silent Failures"
**Problem:** Job fails but no one knows
**Solution:** Explicit logging + notification on error

### Anti-Pattern: "Credential Soup"
**Problem:** API keys scattered across code
**Solution:** Environment variables + secrets management

### Anti-Pattern: "Workflow Spaghetti"
**Problem:** Complex orchestration logic impossible to debug
**Solution:** Modular functions, clear state transitions

### Anti-Pattern: "Testing in Production"
**Problem:** Can't test without triggering real systems
**Solution:** Mock endpoints, dry-run modes, synthetic data

### Anti-Pattern: "Zombie Jobs"
**Problem:** Old jobs still running when new ones start
**Solution:** Lock files, overlap detection, proper cleanup

---

## 🔧 NAMING CONVENTION (CRITICAL)

### All files, variables, and code must follow dayXX_ prefix pattern:

**File Naming:**
```
day11/
├── day11_n8n_workflow.json
├── day11_CONFIG_settings.py
├── day11_SCHEDULER_cron.py
├── day11_requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

**Python Naming:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
DAY11_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://..."
DAY11_SCHEDULE_CRON = "0 8 * * *"

class day11_WorkflowOrchestrator:
    pass

def day11_send_daily_report():
    pass

# ❌ WRONG - Generic names cause conflicts
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://..."  # Too generic
class Orchestrator:  # No prefix
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# In config/.env

# Day 11 - n8n Retail Reports
DAY11_N8N_API_KEY=abc123
DAY11_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://...
DAY11_SCHEDULE_CRON="0 8 * * *"

# Day 12 - Great Expectations
DAY12_GE_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/day12/great_expectations
DAY12_DATA_SOURCE_PATH=/path/to/day12/data

# Day 13 - Alert Triage
DAY13_ALERT_CHECK_INTERVAL=300
DAY13_AUDIT_LOG_PATH=/path/to/day13/audit.db

# Day 14 - Email Reports
DAY14_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
DAY14_SMTP_PORT=587
DAY14_SENDER_EMAIL=reports@example.com

# Day 15 - Redis Pipeline
DAY15_REDIS_HOST=localhost
DAY15_REDIS_PORT=6379
DAY15_WEBHOOK_PORT=5000
```

---

## 🔄 PIVOT RULE (1 hour)

**For all Orchestration projects:**

If after **1 hour** you still haven't:
- Got basic automation working OR
- Successfully tested one end-to-end flow

➡️ **IMMEDIATE PIVOT to simpler approach:**

1. Use print() instead of proper logging (can improve later)
2. Use simple file-based queue instead of Redis
3. Use webhook.site to test webhooks instead of real endpoints
4. Skip fancy email templates → plain text is fine
5. Use simple while loop instead of APScheduler

**DON'T spend more than 1h fighting with setup. The goal is to deliver, not perfectionism.**

**Example Pivot Scenarios:**

**Day 11 (n8n):**
```bash
# After 1h, if n8n setup too complex:

# BEFORE (complex):
# Trying to install n8n locally, configure nodes...

# AFTER (simple pivot):
# Create Python script that mimics the workflow
# Document: "Prototyped in Python, production would use n8n"
# Include architecture diagram showing how n8n would implement it
```

**Day 15 (Redis + Webhooks):**
```bash
# After 1h, if Redis connection issues:

# BEFORE (complex):
# Debugging Redis connection, setting up clusters...

# AFTER (simple pivot):
# Use in-memory queue (Python queue.Queue)
# Use JSON file as persistence layer
# Document: "MVP uses in-memory queue, production would use Redis"
```

## 📄 ORCHESTRATION README EXAMPLE

### Quick Reference: Adapting TEMPLATE_PROJECT_README.md for Orchestration

When using [TEMPLATE_PROJECT_README.md](TEMPLATE_PROJECT_README.md), make these orchestration-specific adaptations:

#### Executive Summary Example:
```markdown
## Executive Summary

**Business Problem:** Manual daily reporting requires 2 hours of analyst time to pull Google Ads and GA4 data, calculate KPIs, and send to stakeholders.

**Solution Delivered:** Automated n8n workflow that fetches data, calculates 18 KPIs, and sends formatted Slack report daily at 8am UTC.

**Business Impact:** Reduces reporting time from 2 hours to 5 minutes (96% time savings). Ensures consistent delivery and eliminates weekend delays.

**For:** Gleyson (Retail Marketing) | **Time:** 3 hours | **Status:** ✅ Complete
```

#### Solution Overview Example:
```markdown
## Solution Overview

### What It Does

| Capability | Business Outcome |
|------------|------------------|
| **Scheduled Data Collection** | Automatically pulls GA4 and Google Ads data daily |
| **Multi-Source Integration** | Combines analytics and advertising metrics in single report |
| **Intelligent Fallback** | Uses local CSV if API unavailable (99.9% uptime) |
| **Smart Formatting** | Slack Block Kit formatting for mobile-friendly reading |
| **Error Notifications** | Team alerted within 60 seconds if workflow fails |

### Architecture at a Glance
```
[TRIGGER] → [ORCHESTRATION] → [DESTINATION]
    ↓              ↓                ↓
Schedule (8am) → n8n Workflow → Slack Channel
                   │
                   ├─ Fetch GA4 (HTTP)
                   ├─ Fetch Ads (HTTP)
                   ├─ Calculate KPIs (Code)
                   ├─ Format Message (Code)
                   └─ Error Handler → Alert
```
```

#### Key Results Example:
```markdown
## Key Results & Insights

### Automation Metrics (Production)

| Metric | Result | Implication |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Success Rate** | 99.2% (122/123 executions) | Highly reliable for daily operations |
| **Avg Execution Time** | 47 seconds | 97% faster than manual process |
| **Errors Handled** | 8 API failures → CSV fallback | Zero missed reports in 30 days |
| **Time Saved** | 60 hours/month | Analyst can focus on insights vs data collection |

### Analytical Capabilities Demonstrated

- ✅ **Schedule-based automation** - Cron triggers with timezone handling
- ✅ **Multi-source data integration** - GA4 + Google Ads unified
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - CSV fallback prevents silent failures
- ✅ **Rich notifications** - Slack Block Kit with 13 formatted sections
- ✅ **Error monitoring** - Immediate alerts on workflow failures
```

#### Architectural Decisions Example:
```markdown
### Architectural Decisions

#### Decision 1: n8n vs Python Script for Orchestration

**Context:** Need daily automation with error handling and monitoring

**Options Evaluated:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **Pure Python + Cron** | Version control, portable, free | No visual monitoring, harder debugging | ❌ Rejected |
| **n8n Workflow** | Visual editor, built-in error handling, execution history | Requires n8n instance, harder version control | ✅ **Chosen** |
| **Airflow** | Enterprise-grade, powerful | Overkill for single workflow, complex setup | ❌ Rejected |

**Rationale:** n8n provides best balance of ease-of-use and features for single daily workflow. Visual canvas helps stakeholders understand process. Built-in execution history aids debugging.

**Tradeoffs Accepted:**
- ✅ **Gained:** Visual monitoring, built-in retry logic, stakeholder transparency
- ⚠️ **Sacrificed:** Pure code version control, infrastructure portability

**Generalization:** Use n8n for <10 simple workflows with non-technical stakeholders. Scale to Airflow when >20 workflows or complex dependencies needed.
```

#### Risks & Limitations Example:
```markdown
## Risks & Limitations

### Current Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation Path |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Single Slack channel** | All stakeholders get same report | Add routing logic based on department |
| **No data validation** | Bad data propagates to report | Add Great Expectations checkpoint before send |
| **Daily only** | Cannot handle urgent ad-hoc requests | Add Slack slash command trigger (/report-now) |
| **CSV fallback local only** | Won't work in cloud deployment | Store CSVs in S3/Google Drive instead |

### Assumptions Made

1. **API availability >95%** - Google Ads/GA4 APIs assumed stable (CSV fallback mitigates)
2. **Slack always available** - No email fallback if Slack down (acceptable for internal tool)
3. **Weekday reporting sufficient** - Weekend skip logic assumes Mon-Fri business (configurable)
```

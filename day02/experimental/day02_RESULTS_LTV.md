## Part 1: Lifetime Value (LTV) Analysis

### 1.1 Follower Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **LTV per Follower** | $55.97 |
| **Monthly Value per Follower** | $2.33 |
| **Annual Value per Follower** | $27.98 |
| **Total Account Value** (102,768 followers) | **$5,751,862** |
| **Posting Cadence** | 1.11 posts/day (33.3 posts/month) |
| **Monthly Impressions per Follower** | 5.85 |

### 1.2 Revenue Model Breakdown (Monthly per Follower)

The LTV calculation is based on a 24-month projection with three revenue streams:

```
Ad Revenue:        $0.03  (1.3%)
Sales Revenue:     $1.90  (81.6%)  ← Primary revenue driver
Sponsored Posts:   $0.40  (17.1%)
─────────────────────────
Total Monthly:     $2.33  (100%)
```

**Key Assumptions:**
- CPM: $5.00 per 1,000 impressions
- Conversion Rate: 2%
- Average Order Value: $50
- Sponsored Post Rate: $0.10 per follower

### 1.3 Content ROI Analysis

| Content Type | Posts | Avg Engagement | Value/Post | Cost | ROI | Net Profit |
|--------------|-------|----------------|------------|------|-----|------------|
| **IMAGE** | 54 | 32.17% | $4,353 | $50 | **8,607%** | $4,303 |
| **CAROUSEL_ALBUM** | 34 | 32.83% | $4,690 | $100 | **4,590%** | $4,590 |
| **VIDEO** | 12 | 33.15% | $4,326 | $200 | **2,063%** | $4,126 |

**Strategic Insight:**
While IMAGE posts have the highest ROI percentage, CAROUSEL_ALBUM posts deliver the highest net profit per post ($4,590). The recommendation is to maintain a balanced mix:
- **60% IMAGE** (low cost, high ROI, volume play)
- **30% CAROUSEL** (highest net profit, mid cost)
- **10% VIDEO** (highest engagement, high cost, quality over quantity)

### 1.4 Engagement Value

| Interaction Type | Value per Action |
|------------------|------------------|
| Like | $0.05 |
| Comment | $0.50 |
| Save | $2.50 |
| Share | $1.00 |

- **Average Engagement Value per Post:** $691.67
- **Monthly Engagement Value:** $20,750.24

**Required State:**
- Weekly growth: 2.83%
- Monthly follower gain: ~16,200

**Gap:** **18.7x increase in growth rate**

To achieve the optimistic scenario (196K followers in 6 months):
